In a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, ==experience replay should sample with replacement==. This means that each time a mini-batch of experiences is sampled from the replay buffer, each experience is drawn independently, and the same experience can potentially be sampled multiple times.

Here are a few reasons why sampling with replacement is used in DQN:

Independence of samples: Sampling with replacement ensures that the experiences in each mini-batch are independent of each other. This helps in breaking the correlation between consecutive experiences, which is one of the main goals of using experience replay.

Diverse mini-batches: Sampling with replacement allows for more diverse mini-batches. Since each experience can be sampled multiple times, the mini-batches can contain a wider variety of state-action-reward-next state tuples.

Effective use of the replay buffer: When experiences are sampled with replacement, each experience in the replay buffer has a chance to be used in multiple training updates. This can help in more effectively utilizing the stored experiences, especially if the replay buffer is large.

In contrast, sampling without replacement would mean that once an experience is sampled for a mini-batch, it cannot be sampled again for that mini-batch. This approach could lead to less diverse mini-batches and might not break the correlations between consecutive experiences as effectively.

Therefore, in the context of DQN, experience replay typically samples experiences with replacement to ensure the mini-batches used for training are more independent and diverse.

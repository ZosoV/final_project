# Final Project

**Title:** TBD

## TODOs

Remember keep this TODO list simple. Things that you can achieve

Remember to start keeping notes of what you are learning and writing that could used to write the background information in your thesis.

- [ ] Read bi-simulaiton in this book together with ChatGPT ZOTERO
- [ ] Read abstraction in reinforcement learning.
- [ ] Read abstract and important stuff
- [ ] Read Challenges in off-line reinforcement learning
- [ ] Read the paper the professor recomended, he is trying me to focus on the idea of getting a minimal model
- [ ] Read other sources if needed. Read abstract and important stuff
- [ ] Decide what to do? This or maybe something more experimental. Something experimental with a great background based in worth it.
 

- [ ] End the reading of how to define different MARL problems (Brief Take Notes)
- [ ] Read MARL book to understand PRO
- [ ] Video of policy gradient methods.
- [ ] Then start reading MARL articles (define later)
- [ ] Read temporal abstractions in the Sutton book
